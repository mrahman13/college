          <h2>
            <u>Introduction</u>
          </h2>
          <p>All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Learning Resources and to use 
            the facilities of the Learning Resources for the purpose of their course of study or College employment. 

            Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated from other organisations:  a fee 
            is usually charged.  Access to the Learning Resources for study purposes may be made available to non-members by
             arrangement. Details are available in the <em>External Services</em> leaflet.
            
            Use of Learning Resources facilities implies acceptance of the Learning Resources rules printed below.  These 
            are designed to protect the interests of all users of Learning Resources and to ensure that the College operates
             within the law and can carry out its functions efficiently and effectively.  The Learning Resources rules apply
              in principle to all Learning Resources sites, including workstation rooms and site libraries, notwithstanding 
              some variations in practice in the site libraries.  Admission to the Learning Resources is conditional upon 
              observation of the rules and the staff of the Learning Resources are empowered to enforce them. 
            
            Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Learning Resources Disciplinary Action (see below), including
             the withdrawal of some or all Learning Resources facilities, and if appropriate by invoking the College’s <em>Regulations 
              for Students </em>
             , in the case of students, or in the case of staff through the appropriate College procedures as set out
               in the <em>Staff Handbook</em>
               . 
            </p>
            <h2>
              <u>Rules</u>

  <li>Individuals or organisations who are not eligible for membership but have good reason to use the Learning Resources  may be admitted, 
    by arrangement, for purposes of study only. Procedures for seeking admission are outlined in the <em>External Services</em>

    the College's Academic Network.</li>
    <li>	ID cards issued by the College or Learning Resources are not transferable from one person to another.  The person named on each card

       loss or damage.</li>
    <p><em>Users of the Learning Resources are reminded that they must be willing to show  ID cards or other identification when requested to do so by College staff.</em></p>

                 seat.  Articles left unattended may be removed by Learning Resources staff but will be returned on request at the Reception
                  Desk.</li>
              <li>All users are required to conduct themselves quietly throughout the Learning Resources and conversation between users

                <li>Users should not make use of mains electrical supplies to power their own equipment, including external storage devices,  
                  unless the equipment has been tested and confirmed as meeting the required Health & Safety standards.  Written evidence of
